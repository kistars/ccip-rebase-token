## Cross-chain Rebase Token

1. A protocal that allows user to deposit into a vault and in return, receiver rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.

2. Rebase token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time.
    - Balance increases linearly with time
    - Mint tokens to our users every time they peform an action (minting, burning, transfering or bridging)

3. Interest rate
    - Indivually set an interest rate or each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault.
    - This global interest rate can only decrease to incetivise/reward early adopters.
    - increate token adoption.
